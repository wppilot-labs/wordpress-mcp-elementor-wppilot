 * Which classic (v3) Elementor elements have an atomic (v4) equivalent.

 * One table, two readers. The readiness audit uses it to answer "how much of
 * this site can an atomic-only tool touch"; WPPilot Pro's converter uses the
 * same entries to decide what a classic element becomes. Keeping it in the free
 * plugin is the point - an audit that says a widget is mappable and a converter
 * that then cannot map it is worse than either alone.
 *
 * An entry is an honest structural equivalent, not a resemblance. `icon-list`
 * is absent because atomic has no list element: it can be rebuilt as a flexbox
 * of paragraphs, but that is a reconstruction with its own losses and belongs in
 * a converter's loss report rather than in a table that claims equivalence.
 *
 * This is deliberately *not* the list of widgets Elementor's own MCP supports.
 * That list is theirs, changes on their release schedule, and is tracked
 * separately in the audit so the two can disagree without either being wrong.
