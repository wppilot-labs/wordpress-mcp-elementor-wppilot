/**
 * Run every control an ability call must pass before WP_Ability::execute().
 *
 * Each execution path used to carry its own copy of this sequence: the modern MCP transport, the
 * REST shim, the core-run gate and Pro's approval replay each reproduced the profile check, the
 * confirmation contract and the confirm strip by hand, and the modern transport then called the
 * rate limiter and preview gate directly because it had no refusable filter. Chat carried none of
 * it and called execute() straight away, so a Chat write skipped the rate limit, the design and
 * preview gates and anything a companion plugin had added. Every copy was a place for the next
 * control to be forgotten, which is how Chat fell behind.
 *
 * The order is fixed:
 *
 * 1. Safety profile. Refused before anything else, so a call the profile forbids never reaches a
 *    rate bucket or an approval queue.
 * 2. Confirmation. A destructive or critical ability needs `confirm: true`, unless the caller says
 *    a human already approved this exact call in wp-admin (`human_approved`) — Chat's approve
 *    button and Pro's approval queue. A model can set `confirm` itself; it cannot set that context.
 *    In the `human` confirmation mode `confirm` stops counting, and the call needs an elicitation
 *    answer or a wp-admin approval instead (wppilot_confirm_ability_call()).
 * 3. Confirm strip. `confirm` is a transport control, not ability input, and is removed unless the
 *    ability declares its own property of that name, because schema validation rejects unknown
 *    members.
 * 4. `wppilot_pre_ability_execute`. Rate limit (6), design gate (7), preview gate (8) and Pro's
 *    approval and lapsed-licence holds (9) all attach here, on every transport.
 *
 * The ability's own permission callback is not called here: execute() runs it, and running it
 * twice would drift from core's contract the moment core changed it.
 *
 * @param string                     $transport `rest`, `mcp`, `chat`, `approval` or `nested` (an
 *                                              ability a kit ability runs on the caller's behalf, e.g.
 *                                              on another network site). Filters use it to decide
 *                                              what applies; the approval queue, for one, only holds
 *                                              `rest` and `mcp` calls.
 * @param array{human_approved?: bool, elicitation?: array{supported?: bool, state?: string, response?: mixed}} $context
 *        `elicitation` is set by the modern MCP transport only; see wppilot_confirm_ability_call().
 * @return mixed The input to pass to execute(), or a WP_Error explaining the refusal.
