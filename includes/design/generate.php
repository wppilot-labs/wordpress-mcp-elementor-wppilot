/**
 * Resolve a design brief into a design.
 *
 * A design document names fixed values: this hex, that face, 56px. That is the
 * right shape for a brand somebody decided, and the wrong shape for the job of
 * producing a hundred sites that are each their own thing. Fixed values can
 * only be reused, and a reused design is a template however good it was the
 * first time.
 *
 * So a brief names intent and ranges instead — a hue window, a contrast floor,
 * a scale ratio band, how adventurous the compositions may be — and this
 * resolves them against the site's seed. Same brief on two sites gives two
 * designs; same brief on one site gives the same design however many times it
 * runs. That is the difference between a system and a preset, and it is the
 * only way to have consistency and variation at once.
 *
 * Nothing here is random. Every value is derived, which is what makes the
 * result reproducible, auditable, and re-derivable after an edit rather than a
 * lucky roll nobody can get back.
 *
 * What is deliberately not derived: anything the brief states outright. A brand
 * with a real colour says so and it is used verbatim. Deriving is for the
 * decisions nobody has made, not for overriding the ones they have.
