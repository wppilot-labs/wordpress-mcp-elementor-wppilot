/**
 * Put the active design in front of the agent before it builds anything.
 *
 * The write gate refuses drift, which is the backstop. This is the part that
 * makes the backstop rarely fire: an agent that already knows the palette and
 * the type stack does not reach for the statistical average, because it has
 * something specific to reach for instead. Prevention is cheaper than a refusal
 * for everyone — the agent, the round trip, and the person waiting.
 *
 * Deliberately a summary, not the whole DESIGN.md. The full document is one
 * `get-active-design` call away and carries the rationale an agent should read
 * before serious visual work; what belongs here is the machine contract it must
 * not violate, small enough to sit in every session's context without crowding
 * out the rest of the instructions.
 *
 * The rendered block is untrusted content, and says so. A DESIGN.md can be
 * imported from anywhere, so every value in it — names, token values, Do and
 * Don't lines — is text from a file rather than instruction from the site. The
 * `wppilot-design` skill makes the same point at greater length; the fence and
 * the warning here are what protect the agent that never loads it.
 *
 * That fence is also why this file has two halves. Everything the design says
 * about itself goes inside it as data. Everything the site says about how to
 * build — contrast floors, one h1, populate before moving on — goes outside it
 * as instruction, because those are ours and are the same on every install. A
 * standard that sits inside the fence is a standard the agent has been told to
 * distrust.
 *
 * What this carries is deliberately most of what a good hand-written brief
 * carries. A well-written page prompt supplies a palette, a type stack, the
 * ladders, the compositions worth using, and the standards a finished page has
 * to meet — and then only works for the one page somebody pasted it into. This
 * fires on every request, including the small ones nobody would write a brief
 * for: "make the hero bigger" arrives with the same direction attached as a
 * full build.
