/**
 * Decisions derived from the site rather than from the model's taste.
 *
 * Every AI-built site looks like every other one for a reason that is not a
 * shortage of options. Aligned models regress toward the statistical mode of
 * what they were trained on, so asked for a typeface they answer Inter, asked
 * for a layout they answer three equal cards, and asked again they answer the
 * same thing. Shipping forty typefaces and seven compositions does not fix
 * that: a strong prior picks the same three faces out of forty every time.
 * Vocabulary was never the constraint.
 *
 * The fix is to stop asking. When a choice has several defensible answers, the
 * answer is derived from the site — its address and the design's name — rather
 * than chosen. Two sites with identical briefs then diverge because their seeds
 * differ, and one site rebuilt lands on the same design because its seed does
 * not. Reproducible and unlike its neighbours are usually treated as opposing
 * goals; deriving gets both, and asking gets neither.
 *
 * The grammar chooser has worked this way from the start and it is the only
 * place that did. Everything a design decides between — a palette's hue, a type
 * pairing, a corner radius, how dense or adventurous the page is — can come
 * from here instead.

 * is the right trade: a site that moves house rarely wants to keep a palette
 * that was derived rather than chosen, and anything actually chosen is written
 * down in the design document and never derived at all.
