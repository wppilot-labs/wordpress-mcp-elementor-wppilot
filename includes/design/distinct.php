 * its own terms: does the accent carry text, is the type scale declared, is the
 * palette applied in a sane proportion. A design can pass all of them and still
 * be the fourth site this month with a navy ground, a warm grey body face and
 * an asymmetric split in the hero.
 *
 * That is the failure the anti-tell rules do not catch, because nothing about
 * any one page is wrong. It only shows up in the aggregate, and the aggregate
 * is exactly what an agency sees when it lines up the sites it shipped.
 *
 * The comparison is deliberately shallow: palette distance, whether the type
 * pairing is identical, and how much of the grammar set is shared. Deeper
 * similarity measures would be more accurate and far more likely to produce a
 * confident wrong answer, and a warning nobody trusts is worse than no warning.
 * Nothing here refuses a design. Two sites in one franchise are supposed to
 * look alike; the check reports, the human decides.
