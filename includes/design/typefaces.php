/**
 * A considered set of typefaces, and the rule for pairing two of them.
 *
 * Asked for a font, a model reaches for Inter, Poppins, Montserrat or Playfair
 * Display, because those are the faces the training data is full of. The
 * pre-flight already refuses Inter by name, which stops the single worst case
 * and does nothing about the other three — and a rule that only says no leaves
 * whatever comes next to the same habit that produced the first answer.
 *
 * So this is the other half: a set to choose from, with enough about each face
 * to choose on purpose. Every entry says what the face sounds like and what it
 * can carry, because "a serif" is not a decision and "a transitional serif with
 * enough weight to hold a headline and a large enough x-height to set at 16px"
 * is.
 *
 * Deliberately not a catalogue. Around forty faces, all from Google Fonts so
 * they load on any install without a licence conversation, spanning grotesque to
 * old-style to didone to mono. A picker with five hundred faces optimises for
 * looking comprehensive; this optimises for a defensible pairing being the
 * easiest thing to reach.
 *
 * The over-used faces are kept rather than omitted. A design that genuinely
 * wants Montserrat should be able to name it and be told what that costs, which
 * is a more useful answer than pretending the face does not exist.

/**
 * Whether two faces make a defensible pairing, and why or why not.
 *
 * A pairing works on contrast. Two faces from the same super-class almost never
 * contrast enough to look intentional — they look like one face that went
 * slightly wrong, which is the most common way a considered-looking site gives
 * itself away. So the rule is structural rather than aesthetic: the two must
 * differ in super-class, or one of them must be a display face, or they must
 * come from the same superfamily.
 *
 * That last exception matters. IBM Plex Sans over IBM Plex Mono breaks the
 * different-super-class rule and is a better pairing than most that satisfy it,
 * because the two were drawn against each other. A rule that could not express
 * that would refuse the best answer in the set.
 *
 * The body face is checked separately for whether it can actually carry body
 * text. Setting a paragraph in Bodoni Moda or Archivo Black is not a bold choice,
 * it is a mistake, and it is the mistake a model makes when it picks two faces it
 * likes the look of without asking what each one has to do.
 *
 * Over-use is reported separately from the structural objections, because the
 * two are not the same kind of problem. Two geometric sans together do not work;
 * Montserrat works perfectly and is merely everywhere. A caller browsing for a
 * partner can reasonably ask to see the common faces anyway, and could not if
 * being common disqualified a face the same way as having no contrast.
