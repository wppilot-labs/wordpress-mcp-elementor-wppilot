/**
 * A reproduction spec: the measurements of a design somebody is asking for.
 *
 * DESIGN.md is a direction. It names a palette, two faces and a set of dials,
 * deliberately leaves layout open, and asks "is this page in the spirit of the
 * brand". That is the right shape for inventing a site and the wrong shape
 * entirely for "build the page in this screenshot", because nothing in it can
 * carry the one thing reproduction needs: the actual numbers, in order.
 *
 * Asked to match a reference without them, a model infers. It gets the palette
 * right, because colour is the part a screenshot gives away, and it invents the
 * rest: the section sequence, the container width, the type scale, the weight.
 * The result shares a palette with the target and matches nothing else, and
 * there is no check anywhere that notices, because every existing rule asks
 * whether the page is any good rather than whether it is the page that was
 * asked for.
 *
 * So a spec is measurements, and it is measurements the caller supplies. The
 * plugin deliberately does not try to see the design: a screenshot, a Figma
 * file and a rendered URL are three different extraction problems, all of them
 * better solved by the agent that already has vision and a browser than by PHP
 * guessing at a JPEG. What the plugin owns is the part an agent is bad at —
 * holding the numbers exactly, turning them into real builder primitives with
 * no hand-made classes, and saying afterwards how far off the result landed.
