/**
 * Worked example directions, shipped as real DESIGN.md files.
 *
 * These are examples, not a catalogue. The distinction is the whole design of
 * this module: there is no ability that applies one, no picker that installs
 * one, and nothing anywhere calls them themes or presets. An agent reads one to
 * see what a finished direction looks like — how the reasoning is written down,
 * how a palette is checked against contrast before it is committed to, how a
 * "Don't" list is phrased so the gate can act on it — and then writes one for
 * the site in front of it.
 *
 * A picker would be the more marketable feature and it would make the product
 * worse. Fifty selectable palettes produce fifty sites that look like the
 * palette rather than like the business, which is the exact failure the design
 * system exists to prevent; and it would contradict the pre-flight, which flags
 * a cream-and-terracotta palette precisely because it is what gets reached for
 * when nobody decided anything.
 *
 * Each file is a genuine DESIGN.md that passes the contract, so an agent can
 * read the tokens as well as the prose, and the set deliberately spans
 * light/dark, serif/sans, dense/airy and loud/quiet rather than being seven
 * variations on a safe middle.
