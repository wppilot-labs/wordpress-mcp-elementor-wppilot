/**
 * Turn measurements of several reference pages into a convention report.
 *
 * The alternative is what everybody else ships: a file per industry saying
 * dental sites have these eight sections in this order. It works instantly, it
 * is stale the month it is written, it covers only the industries somebody
 * thought of, and — worst — it hands every dentist the identical page. A
 * prescribed structure is a template; moving it from the pixel level to the
 * section level does not stop it being one.
 *
 * Measured evidence answers the same question and one more. A property that
 * appears in every reference is a convention, and whether to honour it or break
 * it depends entirely on which kind it is. A booking button above the fold is
 * functional: eight out of eight means it works, and breaking it costs the
 * client money. Three equal cards is decorative: eight out of eight means it is
 * the thing that makes all eight look alike, and matching it is how the ninth
 * site becomes invisible.
 *
 * So the report splits on that line and refuses to collapse it. A single
 * frequency table cannot tell you which way to move, and the split is the whole
 * value: it says what to keep and what to avoid, from the same data.
