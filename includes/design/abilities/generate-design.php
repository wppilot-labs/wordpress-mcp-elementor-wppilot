Every AI-built site resembles every other one for a reason that is not a shortage of options: an aligned model regresses to the most familiar answer, so asked for a typeface it says Inter and asked for a layout it says three equal cards, however many alternatives it was given. This does not ask. A mood names a hue window, and the hue, the ground, the type pairing, the scale ratio, the corner family, the spacing and the permitted compositions are all derived from the site address and the design name. Two sites with the same brief get different designs; one site re-run gets the same design, because nothing here is random. Colour is solved rather than sampled: ink is pushed until it clears 12:1 on the ground and the accent until it carries ink at 7:1, and a brief that cannot be solved is refused rather than shipped unreadable. Anything the brief states outright is used verbatim, because deriving is for the decisions nobody has made. Returns the tokens and a ready DESIGN.md to review and save.',

        For {$subject}. The register is {$r['mood']}, and everything below was derived from this
        site rather than picked, which is the point: the same brief on another site resolves to a
        different design, and this site re-run resolves to this one.

        ## The reasoning

        The ground is {$r['ground']} at `{$c['bg']}`, and it is not white or black. Both of those
        read as a default nobody touched, and the difference between paper and white is most of
        what separates a page from a lightbox.

        The ink is `{$c['ink']}`, solved against the ground rather than chosen: it clears
        {$ink_pct}:1, so it carries the whole document and there is no second text colour.

        `{$c['accent']}` is the accent and it is a fill, not a foreground. Ink on it clears
        {$accent_pct}:1, which is why it can be as loud as it likes without the text suffering.
        Spend it three or four times a page. An accent that appears everywhere is a brand colour
        applied; one that appears once per screen is a decision.

        {$r['faces']['display']} over {$r['faces']['body']}. The pairing was drawn and then checked
        against the rule that refuses two faces of the same class and a display face set as body
        copy, so it contrasts on the axis that matters and reads as one publication rather than two.

        The scale steps at {$scale}. That single number changes a page more than the palette does:
        below 1.3 it reads as a document, above 1.6 as a poster.

        Sections are composed rather than stacked, from a subset of the available grammars rather
        than all of them. A design that permits everything has decided nothing, and two sites that
        permit everything end up with the same spread.

        ## Don't

        - Don't put body text on the accent. It is a fill that carries ink.
        - Don't add a second text colour. The ink carries the document.
        - Don't introduce a heading size between the two the scale declares.
        - Don't centre a paragraph. A heading may centre, running text never does.
        - Don't use three equal cards in a row. Give the set a shape.
        - Don't write a heading that survives a find-and-replace of the business name.
