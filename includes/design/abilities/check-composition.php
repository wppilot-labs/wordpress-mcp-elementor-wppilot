/**
 * Validate a composition — a block subtree written down on its own.
 *
 * This is the piece that lets composition knowledge be captured instead of
 * shipped. Everyone else answers the cold-start problem with a file per
 * industry: a dentist's homepage has these eight sections in this order. It
 * works the day it is written, it is stale the month after, it covers only the
 * trades somebody listed, and it hands every dentist the same page. Moving the
 * prescription from pixel level to section level does not stop it being a
 * template.
 *
 * The alternative is not to know less, it is to know from evidence. Measure a
 * reference in a browser, write what it is actually made of in this vocabulary,
 * and check it here. What comes back is either a composition that will build,
 * or the reason it will not — and because it goes through the same normalizer a
 * spec's blocks go through, anything that passes is expressible, buildable and
 * gradeable rather than being notes in a second format that drifts.
 *
 * The plugin never ships a composition. It ships the grammar for saying one.

Call wppilot/get-design-spec with no slug first for the vocabulary. This is deliberately not a library of shapes: a file per industry saying what a dentist\'s homepage contains works the day it is written, is stale a month later, covers only the trades somebody listed, and gives every dentist the same page. Prescribing at section level rather than pixel level does not stop that being a template. So nothing is shipped, and what you measure is checked against the same normalizer a spec uses — anything that passes here will build, and can be graded against afterwards.
