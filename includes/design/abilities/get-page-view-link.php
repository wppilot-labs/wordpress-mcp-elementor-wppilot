 * the button is legible on that photograph, whether the third card wrapped onto
 * its own row at 1024px - those are visual facts, and reading HTML answers none
 * of them.
 *
 * Most MCP clients already have a browser. This closes the loop with the one
 * they have rather than by building a second one: it returns the address to
 * open, the widths worth looking at, and - for a page nobody can see yet - the
 * sign-in exchange that makes the draft visible to that browser.
 *
 * Deliberately not a screenshot ability. WPPilot has no renderer; when the
 * caller has no browser either, wppilot/capture-page asks the site's own
 * logged-in tab to take the picture instead.
