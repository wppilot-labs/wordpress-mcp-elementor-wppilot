/**
 * Section grammars: the compositions a page is built from.
 *
 * Every other token group describes how a page looks. This one describes how it
 * is arranged, and arrangement is what people actually recognise. A palette can
 * be perfect and the page still reads as machine-made, because generated pages
 * share one shape: a vertical stack of full-width bands, each a centred heading
 * over two or three equal columns. That shape is not a taste failure. It is the
 * only shape available when the vocabulary is nested flex containers, so it is
 * the shape that gets produced every time.
 *
 * A grammar is a named composition with its responsive behaviour attached. It
 * carries no colour, no typeface and no copy — only structure — so the same
 * grammar in two different designs produces two pages that share a skeleton and
 * nothing else, which is exactly the relationship between two well-designed
 * sites by the same studio.
 *
 * They are declared as data rather than built as code because every property
 * used here exists in Elementor 4's own style schema — `position` with its
 * inset-block/inset-inline offsets, `z-index`, `display: grid` with
 * `grid-template-columns`, and per-breakpoint style variants. So a grammar
 * compiles to an ordinary global class: the client can still edit the page
 * afterwards without collapsing it, the write gate can check a named grammar
 * instead of forty inline values, and changing one grammar re-skins every
 * section that uses it.
 *
 * Mobile is defined inside the grammar, never left to the caller. Overlap and
 * absolute positioning are where responsive layouts die, and a grammar that
 * only works at one width is worse than no grammar at all.
