 * approval queue ships off: turning it on changes the contract every connected
 * agent is working to, and that is the site owner's call rather than a default.
 *
 * Scope is named honestly in the setting label. It covers the MCP and REST
 * transports, which are the ones a remote agent uses. The built-in Chat screen
 * calls WP_Ability::execute() directly with no filter in between, and gating it
 * properly means rendering diffs inside the Chat UI — a separate feature, not a
 * line in this file. Chat has its own approval step in the meantime.
