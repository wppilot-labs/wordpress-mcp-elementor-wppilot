/**
 * All-in-One WP Migration ("All-in-One WP Migration and Backup", verified against 7.112).
 *
 * It keeps no backup history: a backup is a `.wpress` file in its backups folder
 * (AI1WM_BACKUPS_PATH, wp-content/ai1wm-backups unless the `ai1wm_backups_path` option moves
 * it), listed by `Ai1wm_Backups::get_files()` with its file time and size. An export is built in
 * a job folder under AI1WM_STORAGE_PATH and renamed into the backups folder only once its last
 * block is written (Ai1wm_Export_Download), so a file there is a finished export and its file
 * time is when that export finished. Failed exports leave nothing there; the plugin records no
 * verdict for them that this reads.
 *
 * Anything that can write a file can also drop a `.wpress` there, and a backup that counts here
 * lets safe updates and the fresh-backup hold through. So a file counts as a backup only when it
 * sits in the folder itself (exports are never renamed into a subfolder), is at least
 * AI1WM_MIN_BYTES, is not dated in the future, and ends in the archive's end-of-file block as
 * checked by the plugin's own Ai1wm_Extractor::is_valid(), the test its import and restore run.
 * Anything else is listed as `kind: "unverified"`, `result: "unknown"`, and never counts.
 *
 * The file name is never returned. It carries a random suffix that is the only thing guarding a
 * backup on a server that ignores the folder's .htaccess (nginx, OpenLiteSpeed), so it is as good
 * as a download link; a backup's id is a hash of it instead.
 *
 * A running export or import is a job folder (named by uniqid(), 13 hex characters) whose files
 * changed in the last AI1WM_ACTIVE_SECONDS: the archive grows with every step. A folder left by an
 * abandoned run stops changing and stops counting; the plugin's daily cron deletes it after a day.
 *
 * The free plugin has no schedule. WPPilot Pro's wppilot/backup-trigger (1.12.2+) runs the
 * plugin's own `ai1wm_export` steps on the server rather than its loopback requests;
 * `trigger.supported` says whether this install has what that runner calls (ai1wm_runner_missing()).
 * No version is compared: whether the install can be started is read from what it has.
