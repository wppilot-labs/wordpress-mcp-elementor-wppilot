/**
 * The WordPress calls behind Notes, so the review loop's rules are tested apart from them.
 *
 * A note is a comment of type `note` on the post. A top-level note is a thread: open while its
 * comment_approved is '0' (the REST API's `hold`), resolved at '1' (`approve`). Replies are notes
 * whose parent is the thread. Resolving or reopening also adds an empty-content child note whose
 * `_wp_note_status` meta is `resolved` or `reopen`: the thread's history. That is what the block
 * editor in WordPress 7.1 does (editor.js useNoteActions), and doing the same keeps an agent's
 * actions readable in the editor's sidebar.
