 *
 * - `subscriptions`: WPPilot has no change-notification producer. Nothing in
 *   the plugin emits a tools/prompts/resources list-changed event, so opening a
 *   `subscriptions/listen` stream would hold a connection open forever and
 *   deliver nothing. The spec is explicit that a server must not advertise
 *   subscription support merely to satisfy a checklist.
 * - `logging`: deprecated in this revision, and WPPilot emits no
 *   `notifications/message`.
 *
 * Tasks are declared by extensions.php, not here, and only while the extension is enabled.
 *
 * Each capability value is an stdClass, not an empty PHP array. `json_encode()`
 * renders an empty array as `[]`, and the schema types these values as objects —
 * a strictly-validating client rejects `"tools": []` where `"tools": {}` is
 * required.
