 * The adapter (up to 0.6) only hooks its default abilities onto `wp_abilities_api_init` from its
 * own init(), which runs at `init` priority 20 or `rest_api_init`. The registry initializes on the
 * first wp_get_abilities()/wp_get_ability() call after `init`, so any plugin that reads it earlier
 * fires the action before the adapter is listening. Those two abilities then never exist, every
 * mirror server drops them, and a client sees only discover-abilities (WPPilot registers its own)
 * - it can list abilities but never run one. These hooks are added at plugin load, before `init`,
 * so they are always in time; on a site where the adapter's hook did run (priority 10) they find
 * both abilities registered and do nothing.
