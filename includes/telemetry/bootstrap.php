 * Two directions, and the second is why this runs on every admin request rather
 * than on activation:
 *
 * - On: repair a schedule that went missing. A site can lose its cron entries
 *   to a database restore or a migration plugin, and an install that updates
 *   into this version never runs activation.
 * - Off: clear an event that outlived its reason. 1.6.0 reported by default and
 *   scheduled on activation, so a site updating to 1.6.1 without ever having
 *   chosen arrives here with a daily event and no consent behind it. send()
 *   already refuses to report, but leaving a dead event on the schedule is its
 *   own small misstatement of what the plugin is doing.
 *
 * Never turns reporting on: enabled() is false until someone stores a decision.
 * Checked on admin requests only — this must not cost a front-end page view
 * anything.
