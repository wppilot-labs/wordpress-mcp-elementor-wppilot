/**
 * Agent identities: what the access token behind a request may do.
 *
 * An access token used to carry its owner's full access. On most sites that is an
 * administrator, so a token minted for a nightly SEO report could equally delete
 * every page, and the only control was the site-wide safety profile, which also
 * binds the people using Chat. A token now carries its own limits:
 *
 * - a scope: an allowlist of abilities (`rank-math/set-link-settings`), whole
 *   providers (`rank-math/*`) and ability categories. Null means every ability,
 *   which is what every token minted before schema 2 has.
 * - a ceiling: a safety profile the token can never exceed. The effective profile
 *   is the stricter of the site's and the token's, so a ceiling only takes access
 *   away — a Read Only site stays Read Only whatever a token says.
 *
 * Both are enforced where the safety profile already is — wppilot_safety_profile_allows_ability(),
 * wppilot_safety_check_ability() and the `wp_ability_permission_result` filter — so
 * every transport, discovery included, answers the same way without a check of its
 * own. The request's token is read from the Bearer middleware's request-local
 * identity, never from anything the caller sends in the body.
