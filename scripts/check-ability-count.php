/**
 * Fail the build when the number of free abilities in the source differs from the number the
 * documents are checked against.
 *
 * check-doc-consistency.php holds README, readme.txt and the docs to
 * .github/product-facts.json `free_abilities`, but nothing held that number to the code: a new
 * ability — a kit's, say, which lives in includes/kits/ rather than beside the modules it
 * resembles — made every document one short while every check stayed green. This counts what
 * the website's product:sync and the release verifiers count: distinct literal `wppilot/…` names
 * passed to wp_register_ability() or to the WordPress module's register_core_ability() wrapper,
 * anywhere under includes/. Names built at run time are not counted, deliberately; that is how
 * the standalone kit host keeps its `<id>/kit-*` abilities out of WPPilot's total.
 *
 * Usage: php scripts/check-ability-count.php
