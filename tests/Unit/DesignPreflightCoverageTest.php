/**
 * What the checker claims to have checked.
 *
 * Reporting the whole rule list as checked when half of it was skipped is worse
 * than reporting nothing, because it converts "there was no design to measure
 * against" into "we measured and it was fine". That is the exact failure the
 * `not_checked` list exists to prevent everywhere else in this module, and it
 * was quietly happening in the list right next to it.
 *
 * The seam is pinned here too. Craft rules live in Pro and join through a
 * filter, and a rule that runs without being reported is the same
 * mis-statement of coverage in the opposite direction.
