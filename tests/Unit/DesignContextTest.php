 * asked for. A well-written page brief carries a palette, the ladders, the
 * compositions worth using and the standards a finished page owes — and then
 * works for exactly the one page somebody pasted it into. This rides along with
 * every request, including the small ones nobody writes a brief for.
 *
 * That reach is also the risk, and it is the thing these tests defend. Text
 * here costs on every session on every install, so it earns its place by
 * staying small; and it is read as instruction, so nothing that came out of a
 * design file may appear in it unfenced.
