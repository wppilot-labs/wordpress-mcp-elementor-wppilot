/**
 * The comparison behind visual verification.
 *
 * Two failures decide whether this is usable. If it reports every page as
 * changed - which a pixel-exact comparison does, because fonts rasterise
 * differently and images get re-encoded - it gets switched off within a day. If
 * it reports a changed hero as unchanged, it is worse than nothing, because
 * somebody trusted it.
 *
 * So the assertions are about the middle: noise below the threshold stays
 * quiet, a real change is caught, and a changed area comes back as one region
 * rather than as two hundred cells.
